# Dashboard-Highway-Administration

Used React, Material UI, ECharts, and Data Grid to build this entire application.

This application consists of Light and Dark Mode, 4 different Charts, 3 different Data Table Pages. The dashboard page includes 4 measure cards, 1 scrollable data table, 4 different Charts.

This application is based on Vite, which provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
